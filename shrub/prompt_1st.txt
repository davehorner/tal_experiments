create me a uxn varvara tal source that has the ascii art of a shrub embedded in it. it should print the shrub to the console when run. here is the example hello world tal file for reference:
uxntal
        ( dev/console )
        |10 @Console [ &pad $8 &char ]

        ( init )

        |0100 ( -> )

            ;hello-world

            &loop
                ( send ) LDAk .Console/char DEO
                ( incr ) #0001 ADD2
                ( loop ) LDAk ,&loop JCN
            POP2

        BRK

        @hello-world "Hello 20 "World!
---- 
# TAL/UXN assembly syntax for strings. 
## Delimiters
- open: "
- close: any byte <= 0x20 ( ASCII space) The content between the delimiters is emitted as raw ASCII bytes.
To emit a double quote character, use two consecutive quotes followed by a space: "" (emits a single " byte).
Strings can be placed anywhere tokens are allowed (e.g., after instructions, as data).
## Examples: - "HELLO → emits bytes for HELLO. - ""HELP" → emits bytes for "HELP". - "" → emits a single " byte.
No label or macro expansion occurs inside string literals.
only respond with the source code, nothing else.
you should modify the source code to include the ascii art of a shrub using uxntal strings and the tool get_unxtal_quoted_string
